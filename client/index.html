			<h1 >WELCOME, MAYOR.</h1>
			<p>Your city waits.<br><br>Each year, you have the power to reshape its future—one decision at a time. Expand transit, 
				raise skylines, rezone districts, or promise the impossible. You tell the AI what you want done. The system carries 
				it out. One command equals one year. One round closer to the next election.<br><br>But power comes with pressure.<br>
				Your approval rating must stay above 50%. Drop below that, and you're out. People don’t all want the same thing. 
				Rising housing prices may please developers but push out long-time residents. Subsidies might win hearts—or bankrupt 
				trust.<br><br>Every action ripples. Every district remembers.<br>Lead wisely. Or get replaced.<br><br>Good luck

				<h1>Canada's housing crisis is far more complicated than most people think.</h1>
				<p>Today, housing prices have skyrocketed and young people moving out are paying up to 30% more on housing than people 
				50 years ago.<br><br>However, a large majority of the older population's retirement and wealth is tied into their properties, 
				and depend on their property value increasing to live. This dichotomy fuels a political scene that naturally moves to 
				inaction, as doing too much for one side hurts the other.<br><br>We strongly believe first step to making meaningful change 
				is having a solid understanding of the issue at hand, and highly encourage everyone to spend more time educating themselves 
				on the topic.</p>
